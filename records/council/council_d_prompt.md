You are an independent senior ML-systems reviewer (gpt-6-astra, xhigh) doing the PRE-PILOT reconciliation for Phase 4 of a Bengali ASR programme. You audited the design (councils A/B) and did an interim audit (council C) whose 12 required changes were adopted. Be concrete, numeric, adversarial. Contract follows, then NEW FACTS, then QUESTIONS.

# CONTRACT (experiments/p4/SPEC.md, current)
# Phase 4 — FastConformer-CTC large, continued training on an expanded human-labelled Bengali corpus

Registered 2026-09-05 (UTC) before any GPU work. Reconciled from owner decisions (2026-09-05), council A
(`/tmp/council_p4a`, gpt-6-astra xhigh, design) and council B (`/tmp/council_p4b`, gpt-6-astra xhigh, red team).
Where A and B disagree the orchestrator's ruling is stated and marked **RULING**. This file is the contract; a
number that is not here is not registered.

## 0. Owner decisions (verbatim intent)
- Quality over quantity: "even if you get only 500 high-quality hours, keep it"; "useless YouTube … should not be there".
- Admissible labels: human-labelled; **model-filtered human labels are allowed**; pseudo-labels and TTS audio are **not**.
- Architecture: FastConformer-CTC large (Phase-1 lineage). Warm start allowed.
- Steps scale with the data; GPU-hours are not a hard cap ("unbounded … but not six months"). A soft plan of ~200 A5000 GPU-h
  is registered so that budget is still accounted; the owner may raise it, never the orchestrator.
- MaCro human-validated split: train minus a 3–4 h transcript-group-disjoint dev slice.
- Model licence: **CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0** (owner decision, against council advice; the card discloses the OpenSLR-53 CC-BY-SA and
  Phase-1 CC-BY-SA-4.0 lineage exactly as the Phase-2 card does). **Both the HF model repo and the GitHub repo stay PRIVATE** (owner, 2026-09-05: "keep this one private … later I will make it public and still it will be NC"); only the owner flips visibility.
- Human label audit: owner adjudicates ~100 MaCro-filtered clips (+20 flagged) on a listening board.
- **GPU policy amended 2026-09-06 (owner):** the main run stays on the A5000 (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=GPU-3ce8e4c2-3bae-8744-eeec-70e8a0437567`); pilot/ablation arms MAY also run on the A6000 with a **20 GB cap** (watchdog 19.0 GiB), one arm per card, only while no foreign compute process is on that card (checked before launch and by the hourly watcher; a foreign process appearing = our arm pauses at the next checkpoint, never the other way round); co-tenant never disturbed;
  process anonymisation ("6mn lmu"); hourly loss+WER reporting; self-authored commits.

## 1. Sources and admission (allowlist; nothing else is read)
| bucket | origin of labels | rows / hours (pre-carve) | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase-1 corpus `data2/train_corpus_ready.json` (fleurs_train, openslr53, subakko, kathbath, commonvoice, indicvoices) | as Phase 1 | 552,932 / 984.1 h | IN, **re-audited 2026-09-05 (owner: "don't take the previous pipeline for granted")** — the G0.9 rules now apply to it too (see §3); every Phase-1 exclusion stays excluded |
| `macro_filtered` — Bengali.AI competition `train` split ∩ tugstugi WER<15 list | human-written prompt read by crowd speaker, "algorithmically cleaned" by Bengali.AI, then Whisper-WER<15 filtered (3 rounds) | 550,921 / 736.8 h | IN **iff** the audit in §3 passes |
| `macro_validated` — competition `valid` split (= tugstugi's validated list, 29,583 = all but 5 rows) | manually reviewed and corrected by Bengali.AI annotators | 29,583 / 48.9 h | **EXCLUDED FROM TRAINING (owner ruling 2026-09-05, strict G0.9(b): 362/29,583 = 1.22 % of its clips are byte-identical to Common Voice recordings in D/holdout, above the 0.5 % duplicate ceiling).** Used ONLY as the source of dev panel `M` (carved from historically unexposed, hash-clean sentence groups) |
| `madasr` — IISc RESPIN-S1.0 Bengali `train_clean` (2025 release), **whole** | read speech of expert-composed dialect-rich sentences, IISc "clean" slab; CC-BY-4.0 (IISc Terms of Use incorporate CC-BY-4.0: `experiments/p4/licences/RESPIN_Data_TAC.pdf`) | **645,722 / 894.2 h**, 1,791 speakers, 5 dialects, 20,038 distinct sentences (ingested 2026-09-06; 49 rows outside the duration band) | IN iff audit §3 passes. **AMENDMENT 2026-09-05:** tugstugi's 2023 MADASR id list does not map onto this release (numeric ids; 7/1,183 dev texts match), so no upstream Whisper filter applies to this bucket — disclosed on the card. Official `dev` (1,500 clips / 2.27 h / 100 speakers / 5 dialects) → panel `R` |
| Kathbath official valid (HF `ai4bharat/Kathbath` bengali/valid, converted by `tools/p4/p4_ingest_kathbath_valid.py`) | AI4Bharat | 2,236 / 4.05 h / 17 speakers | panel `K` (selection, weight 0.10) — a KNOWN-SPEAKER, text-disjoint panel (shares speakers with Kathbath train); no training rows are removed for it; Kathbath official test is not on HF → no test one-shot |
| `vaani` — ARTPARK-IISc Vaani transcription part, Bengali (owner-approved 2026-09-05) | manually transcribed spontaneous image-description speech (West Bengal districts), transcribers from the same district; CC-BY-4.0, HF gate accepted. Annotation policy (registered after measuring 14,598 rows: 52 % `<noise>` spans, 7 % `<talking>`, 64 % `{brace}`, 5.5 % partial markers): `<span>` tags mark the background condition around the PRIMARY speaker's words → tags deleted, words kept; `[event]` brackets deleted; `{brace}` is an English gloss of the preceding Bengali-script loanword ("লেগ {leg}") → deleted, following case suffix re-attached; rows with `[unintelligible]`/`[inaudible]` DROPPED (partial labels teach deletion, Phase-1 lesson). Residual risk (noise-heavy audio, span semantics) is what the `O+vaani` ablation arm and the 50-clip listening slice test | **train 86,861 / 118.1 h** (3,953 partial-marker rows dropped); validation 10,105 / 13.6 h and test 12,695 / 16.1 h are PROTECTED one-shot panels | IN iff audit §3 passes (own 50-clip listening slice + Phase-1 disagreement); its official validation/test splits are protected, never trained on |
| `spring_inx` — SPRINGLab SPRING_INX_Bengali_R1 + R2 (owner-approved 2026-09-05) | manually transcribed mock conversations/monologues, vendor-collected with preliminary QC (IIT Madras, NLTM); **CC BY 4.0** (portal text archived: `experiments/p4/licences/SPRING_INX_licence_record.md`) | train 374.73 h + 272.98 h (dev 70 h, eval 10 h protected) | IN iff audit §3 passes (own ablation arm) |
| Shrutilipi (any subset, incl. WER<15) | forced alignment | — | **OUT, 0 rows, 0 GPU-h** (Phase-1 −24.6 pp ablation; both councils) |
| tugstugi YouTube pseudo1–9, bn-google-tts, "long" concatenations | pseudo / synthetic / derived | — | **OUT** |
| tugstugi OpenSLR / Kathbath "extra" rows | rows Phase 1 excluded or never downloaded | — | **OUT** (historical exclusions stand; no provenance for re-admission) |

Text targets: the **original human reference** (competition `train.csv` sentence; RESPIN transcript; Phase-1 manifest text) —
never tugstugi's cleaned CSV text (used only as the membership list of filtered ids). Every target is transformed with the
repo's frozen surface `metric_surface(NFC(text), score_punctuation=False)` + whitespace collapse (punctuation → space, Latin
lower-cased, numerals preserved). **RULING:** this is applied to the old corpus too, so pilot arms share one target convention.

Cleaning for new rows (registered limits, publish removal counts per reason): duration 0.5–23.0 s; 2–35 NFC non-space code
points per second; decodable, finite, non-silent audio; non-empty target; no `<unk>` after tokenisation; CTC feasibility
`L + R ≤ T` and `(L+R)/T ≤ 0.90` with the model's real frame count (12.5 Hz), where R = adjacent equal-token pairs.
If any single new bucket loses >1 % of rows to feasibility, STOP and report (do not silently drop a dialect/text type).

Old-corpus re-audit (2026-09-05, text + 500-file/source header sample): 0 duplicate paths; all audio 16 kHz mono (FLEURS-train files are 32-bit FLOAT WAV and
IndicVoices files are FLAC despite the .wav suffix — Python's `wave` cannot read either, `soundfile` can; every audio tool must use soundfile); durations
match headers. Defects found and now handled by G0.9 for ALL buckets: fleurs_train 84 rows with Latin letters (usgs, a1gp) + 11 with
¥/other symbols; subakko 262 Latin rows ("ভিটামিন d") + 450 math-expression rows ("১+৩+৫+৭=১৬": after punctuation→space the target is
a digit soup nobody spoke) + 68.6 % non-NFC raw text (already NFC'd by the surface); openslr53 3,311 rows below 2 chars/s (3.9 h;
one-word prompts inside long silence — legitimate but outside the registered density band, dropped for uniformity). Numerals: the
FLEURS-test references write 18.3 % of sentences with ASCII digits while every training source writes Bengali digits (or none: MaCro,
RESPIN have no digit rows) — a scorer-level convention mismatch Phase 1 also carried; **registered policy (council C #2, #11): keep digit-bearing rows as
written in every arm, drop math expressions, no further headline-driven target or scorer changes, and report after the single
scoring event the share of FLEURS-test errors that are digit tokens** (diagnostic only). Vaani/SPRING one-shot results are produced
only after final checkpoint selection and never influence admission or selection.

**Provenance finding 2026-09-05 (audio audit):** decoded-PCM hashes show MaCro recordings byte-identical to Common Voice Bengali
recordings in our dev panel D and holdout (362 matches in the first 46k MaCro files hashed) — Bengali.AI's crowd-sourced MaCro
INCLUDES Common Voice Bengali audio. Consequences (registered): (a) every training row whose PCM hash equals a protected-panel
recording is removed; (b) training rows are de-duplicated by PCM hash across ALL sources (MaCro ∩ CommonVoice), keeping one copy
by deterministic hash order; (c) the card must state that MaCro and Common Voice overlap and that the count of unique hours is
after hash de-duplication. **Kathbath panel K:** the HF `valid` split shares speaker ids with Kathbath train (27,230 of 46,240 train
rows share a speaker) — K is a KNOWN-SPEAKER, text-disjoint panel and is labelled so; no training rows are removed for it.

**Freeze and precedence (council C #1, #2, registered):** before any pilot update, the source inventories, protected-panel manifests,
transformation code, exclusion ledger and final arm manifests are frozen with checksums. Deduplication and MAX_PER_TEXT reserve
O's retained recordings FIRST; new rows occupy only remaining slots, so every O+bucket arm contains exactly the frozen O rows and
targets. For each audio component (rows sharing a decoded-PCM hash or a confirmed fingerprint match): every alias and every original
reference is checked against protected sets and historical exclusions; any protected match excludes every member; if the
frozen-surface references agree, the already-admissible O row is kept and new-source copies count zero new hours; if they disagree
materially the whole component is excluded for this phase (ASR agreement never selects the reference). G0.9 admission rates use
the ingested candidate count as denominator and are reported both pre-removal and retained. Arithmetic expressions are detected on
the NFC original before punctuation removal. Reported O/N counts are provisional until every audit finishes.

Dedup and carving order: (1) canonical id dedup; (2) decoded-PCM hash dedup; (3) fingerprint dedup across all corpora
(calibrated, §4); (4) remove every training row whose sentence group or audio matches a protected panel; (5) global
`MAX_PER_TEXT = 5` distinct recordings per normalised sentence across all sources (deterministic hash order, never by ASR WER).

## 2. Panels and protected sets (no training row may share a sentence or audio with any of these)
| panel | rows | role |
|---|---|---|
| `D` locked dev `data2/val_corpus.json` | 5,385 | selection + historical comparison (P2 17.03 / P1 20.35 / hishab 22.30, frozen surface) — reported separately, always |
| `M` MaCro validated slice | ≈3.5 h, ≥500 sentence groups, ≤3 recordings/group, groups chosen by seed 20260905 **from sentences with no historical exposure** (not in any Phase-1/2/3 train manifest or tokenizer text) | selection |
| `R` RESPIN official dev (`data4/respin/manifest_madasr_dev.jsonl`) | 1,500 (494 distinct sentences) | selection (only if MADASR admitted) |
| `K` Kathbath official valid (`data4/kathbath/manifest_valid.jsonl`) | 2,236 | selection |
| Kathbath official test; `data2/holdout_corpus.json` (speaker-disjoint IndicVoices-R); conversational slice of D | — | one-shot reports |
| **FLEURS official test** (`bench_assets/eval_fleurs_bn`, split==test, 920 recordings / 349 sentences) | 920 | sealed headline, decoded once |
| FLEURS validation | — | never used (contaminated) |

Selection score (frozen-surface corpus WER, pp): `S = 0.60·D + 0.20·M + 0.10·R + 0.10·K` if MADASR is admitted, else
`S = 0.60·D + 0.30·M + 0.10·K`. Regression guards: no D source worse than P1 by >1.0 pp; conversational slice of D worse by
≤0.5 pp; empty-output rate ≤0.1 %. **Definitions fixed 2026-09-05 (trainer workstream):** conversational slice = D rows with source indicvoices and scenario "Conversation" (774 rows, 6,628 reference words); Phase-1 baselines measured through the new evaluator and stored in `experiments/p4/baseline_p1.json` (D 20.35 frozen; per source commonvoice 19.21 / indicvoices 16.57 / kathbath 12.48 / openslr53 18.10 / subakko 36.83; conversational 21.58; K 14.67; R 32.06). NeMo-internal surface numbers are NOT comparable with the Phase-1 in-training curve (different dataloader filters); only the frozen surface is used for gates. Measured throughput on a smoke manifest: ~745 steps/h (SPEC planning figure 1,000 was optimistic; re-measure on the real arm manifests).

## 3. Pre-GPU gates (Gate 0, CPU only)
- G0.1 Provenance: 100 % of admitted rows trace to an original human reference + allowlisted transformation; counts by source.
- G0.2 Licence record for every source archived under `experiments/p4/licences/`; MADASR admitted only with the IISc terms file.
- G0.3 Leakage audit (text): frozen surface + audit keys (punctuation-deleted, digit-script-folded, joiner-stripped) + fuzzy
  candidates (char similarity ≥0.90 for strings ≥20 chars) against every protected panel → **zero unresolved matches**.
- G0.3/G0.4 coverage (council C #5): audits run over EVERY candidate bucket (incl. Vaani/SPRING protected splits) and candidate M is
  audited against the complete Phase-1/2/3 training audio (PCM + fingerprint) and sentence/tokenizer text; M must still meet its
  hours/group minimum afterwards, else STOP. Historical exposure is recorded separately from current-training overlap.
- G0.4 Leakage audit (audio): decoded-PCM SHA-256 + spectral fingerprint (calibrated on 200 train-only clips × 6 transforms,
  ≥99 % recovery per transform, 0 false confirmations on 10,000 unrelated + 1,000 same-prompt pairs) train × protected panels
  → zero confirmed or unresolved matches. Test-set matching is run as a fixed audit returning only ids/counts.
- G0.5 Tokenizer: Phase-1 `data/tokenizer_v1024_corpus` (sha256 6288cf8e…) unchanged; zero `<unk>` in retained targets;
  tokens/s p50/p95/p99 by source; feasibility rule of §1.
- G0.6 Human audit (owner): listening board of 100 uniformly random `macro_filtered` clips + 20 worst by Phase-1
  disagreement, PLUS 50 uniformly sampled clips from the final retained manifest of EVERY other new bucket (madasr, vaani,
  spring_inx); each 50-clip stratum passes with ≤2 material errors and 0 catastrophic (council C #7). Judgments are published
  before the bucket's pilot. Machine disagreement is never a substitute for the human audit. Material error = >10 % WER of the reference vs what is heard; catastrophic =
  wrong pairing / non-speech / gross truncation. **Pass: ≤5 material per 100 clips of the uniformly-random stratum (the 20 worst-by-disagreement and the 50 madasr clips count only towards the 0-catastrophic clause) and 0 catastrophic anywhere.** A failed bucket
  is excluded whole. Machine disagreement (Phase-1 greedy, ≤0.5 GPU-h) is reported as *ASR-disagreement*, not label noise.
- G0.9(b) **ruling (owner 2026-09-05): the duplicate rate is the INCOMING rate — duplicates against protected panels AND against other sources count, denominator = ingested candidate rows — and cross-corpus copies are NOT exempt.** Consequence already applied: macro_validated excluded from training; macro_filtered, madasr, vaani, spring_inx are judged by the same rule once fully hashed.
- G0.9 **Uniformity gate per bucket (owner principle 2026-09-05: "if a dataset is not uniform, precise and clean after the full
  process, jettison it")**. After ingestion and the frozen-surface transform, every bucket is profiled and must satisfy ALL:
  (a) ≥99 % of rows contain only Bengali script, ASCII/Bengali digits and spaces — rows with Latin letters or other scripts are
  removed (FLEURS references write foreign names in Bengali script; Latin targets are a convention mismatch), and a bucket losing
  >5 % of its rows to this rule is flagged for owner review; (b) empty/duplicate-audio/decode failures <0.5 %; (c) duration-vs-metadata
  mismatches <1 %; (d) the tokens/s p99 ≤ 11 and feasibility loss ≤1 %; (e) a 200-row random sample of targets read by the orchestrator
  shows one consistent transcription convention (no residual tags, no transliteration/gloss doubling, punctuation removed uniformly).
  A bucket that fails any clause is **excluded whole for this phase** — no row-level repair beyond the registered transforms, no
  threshold tuning. Passing G0.9 is necessary, not sufficient: the human audit (G0.6) and the bucket's ablation arm (§5) still apply.
- G0.7 Resource: profile the 21 longest admitted clips at microbatch 12; peak reserved ≤16.5 GiB; watchdog 17.0 GiB.
- G0.8 Admission: ≥500 non-duplicate new hours after all of the above; otherwise STOP Phase 4 and report.

## 4. Initialisation and optimisation (registered)
- Init **A**: all weights of Phase-1 `experiments/fastconformer_ctc_bn_1kh/final.nemo` (sha256 61362a36…; 18 layers, d 512,
  dw-striding 8×, conv BatchNorm, kernel 9; head 1,024 + blank), tokenizer unchanged, BN buffers preserved; **fresh AdamW state,
  fresh scheduler**. Zero-update restoration check: dev WER of the loaded model equals Phase-1's recorded 20.35 % (frozen) ±0.05.
- AdamW (0.9, 0.98) wd 1e-3, clip 1.0, bf16, SpecAug 2×15 / 2×0.05 (Phase-1 values), effective batch 252 = 12 × 21.
- Schedule: warmup 1,000 steps 1e-5 → **peak 2e-4** (RULING between A's 2e-4 and B's 1e-4: Phase 1 tolerated 5e-4 from a
  fresh head; 2e-4 is already a 2.5× reduction), cosine to 1e-5 at **H = 150,000** steps (RULING between A 150k and B 100k:
  ≈27 epochs of 1.4 M rows; owner asked for steps to scale with data; plateau rule below stops earlier if warranted).
- Validation every 2,000 steps (all panels, frozen surface + NeMo-internal for D). Checkpoints: last 2 resumable, best 3 by S,
  immutable milestones (pilot end, 20k, 40k, 80k, 120k, H).
- Progress gate at 20,000: S ≤ S(P1) − 1.5 pp and D ≤ D(P1) − 1.0 pp and guards pass; else STOP.
- Plateau: from 30,000, stop after 5 consecutive validations (10k steps) without ≥0.20 pp improvement of the best S.
- Final checkpoint = lowest eligible S; ties within 0.05 pp → earlier. No averaging, no decoder search.
- Resume semantics: audited — interrupted vs uninterrupted **1,000-step replay across an epoch boundary** must give identical
  sample ids and LRs (the 40-step smoke replay passed on 2026-09-05 but does NOT satisfy this; the 1,000-step replay is a Gate-0
  GPU item, ≈1.5 GPU-h, charged to Gate 0). Resource profiling is repeated on the final admitted manifests' longest clips.

## 5. Pilots — per-bucket ablation (owner directive 2026-09-05: "check all the new data we will be adding")
All arms start from init A with the same schedule prefix; **8,000 steps each = 2.016 M presentations** (equal exposure); validation
at 2k/4k/6k/8k on D, M, K, R (+ Vaani/SPRING official validation splits as one-shot reports, never selection).
| arm | corpus |
|---|---|
| O control | Phase-1 corpus only (re-normalised targets) |
| O+macro_filtered | O + `macro_filtered` |
| O+madasr | O + `madasr` |
| O+vaani | O + `vaani` (if downloaded and audited in time; else deferred to a later registered arm) |
| O+spring_inx | O + `spring_inx` (only if licence confirmed; else not run) |
| N_final | O + every bucket that passed its arm; its own 8k point is compared with O and with the best single-bucket arm |
Stop an arm at any validation for non-finite loss, >1 % empties, or D worse than P1 by >5 pp.
**Bucket pass rule at 8,000** (all required): S ≤ S(O) − 0.3 pp with paired sentence-clustered 95 % CI upper bound < 0 (10,000 draws,
seed 20260905); D ≤ D(O) + 0.3 pp; no D source worse than O by >1.0 pp; conversational slice worse by ≤0.5 pp; empties ≤0.1 %.
**Simultaneous bound (council C #8):** with m predeclared single-bucket arms (m=4: macro_filtered, madasr, vaani, spring_inx), admission additionally requires the paired-bootstrap upper quantile at 1−0.025/m (≈99.4th percentile for m=4) to be below zero. Bootstrap per panel corpus WER first, then form S; report marginal CIs too. An inconclusive bucket (CI includes 0) is excluded with NO claim of equivalence or bad labels. N_final's interval is a conditional selection statistic, not independent confirmation. A bucket that fails is **excluded from N_final** (no re-tuning, no partial admission). N_final is admitted to the long run iff it
passes the same rule against O **and** S(N_final) ≤ S(best single arm) + 0.2 pp (adding buckets must not hurt). If N_final fails but
a single arm passed, the long run uses that single arm's corpus (registered fallback) — **only if G0.8 (≥500 unique new hours after all exclusions) still holds for that corpus**; otherwise STOP unless the owner amends the minimum (council C #9). If nothing passes → **STOP Phase 4**; O is not
promoted; FLEURS stays sealed. The chosen arm resumes from its own 8k checkpoint (optimizer, sampler, RNG) to H with no second warmup.
Capped-mixture arm C (council A) is dropped in favour of this design; a 30 % cap may only be registered later as a new arm.
Pilot cost at the MEASURED 745 steps/h: 6 × 10.7 ≈ 64 GPU-h; continuation 8k→150k ≈ 191 GPU-h; with Gate-0 GPU work, eval and reserve ≈ 292 GPU-h total (council C #12; owner ruled GPU-hours soft, 'not six months' ≈ 12 days of A5000 time). Re-measure throughput on the final arm manifests before the ledger is trusted.

## 6. Headline (one event)
Freeze checkpoint, tokenizer, greedy CTC decoding and scorer; decode 920 FLEURS-test recordings once through the benchmark's
`asr_core` staging; paired sentence-cluster bootstrap (349 clusters, 20,000 draws, seed 20260905, corpus WER = Σedits/Σref words)
against frozen Phase-2 (16.54 %) and Phase-1 (**19.67 %** under the frozen scorer on the 920 test rows — the 19.57 % quoted earlier was a different harness; corrected 2026-09-05 after re-scoring `outputs_a5000/ehzawad_fastconformer/predictions.json`, which the benchmark summary also records as 0.19672) hypotheses. **Success: WER < 16.54 % and the 95 % CI of (P4 − P2) lies
entirely below 0.** "Strong": ≤16.04 %. Report CER, per-panel one-shots, latency (same protocol as Phase 3 SPEC Q4). No second decode.

## 7. Budget ledger (soft; owner may raise)
| item | GPU-h |
|---|---|
| Gate-0 GPU work (disagreement decode, restoration check, profiling) | ≤ 6 |
| Pilots ≤7 × 8k (per-bucket ablation) | ≤ 60 |
| Main run to H incl. validation | ≤ 150 |
| Final eval, export, latency | ≤ 8 |
| Reserve | 12 |
| **Total plan** | **~236 (soft; owner: unbounded but not months)** |

## 8. Claims discipline (card)
"Continued fine-tuning of the Bengali FastConformer-CTC checkpoint on X unique hours of human-labelled Bengali speech; Y hours were
selected upstream by ASR/reference agreement (Whisper, WER<15, 3 rounds, digit rows dropped upstream); no pseudo-label targets or
TTS audio." Disclose: per-source table (creator, version, licence, hours, exclusions), the human audit result, MaCro speaker
separation unknown, FLEURS test history (scored in Phases 1–3), single Phase-4 scoring event, private pipeline, NC-SA vs CC-BY-SA
tension (owner decision). Never: "fully manually verified", "speaker-disjoint everywhere", "SOTA", "reproducible from the public repo".

## 9. Log
- 2026-09-05 (later): council C interim audit (`experiments/p4/council/council_c_interim_audit.md`) → STOP pilots until Gate 0 closes;
  12 required changes adopted above; G0.9(b) reading for MaCro∩CommonVoice duplicates put to the owner.
- 2026-09-05: owner decisions recorded; councils A/B run; MaCro competition bundle (24.7 GB, 963,636 mp3, 32 kHz mono 48 kbps)
  and IISc RESPIN `train_bn_clean` (87.1 GB) downloads started; tugstugi CSV inventory and 0-overlap-with-FLEURS audit done
  (`data4/tugstugi/csv`). tugstugi's `validated` list == competition `valid` split (29,583 of 29,588); his filtered list ⊂ `train`.

# NEW FACTS SINCE COUNCIL C (2026-09-06 04:40 UTC)
- Buckets ingested (frozen surface, registered limits): macro_filtered 550,617 / 736.4 h (304 density rejects); madasr = RESPIN train_clean WHOLE 645,722 / 894.2 h, 1,791 speakers, 5 dialects, 20,038 distinct sentences (i.e. ~32 recordings per sentence on average!); vaani train 86,861 / 118.1 h (3,953 partial-marker rows dropped; verbatim spontaneous transcripts incl. false starts "স্কু উ ল"); spring_inx R1+R2 ingesting now (~650 h expected; plain Latin code-switch words present, prevalence not yet measured). macro_validated 29,462 rows: EXCLUDED from training by the owner's strict G0.9(b) ruling (1.22 % byte-identical to Common Voice recordings in D/holdout); it feeds panel M only: M = 1,964 groups / 3.50 h carved from 7,602 historically-unexposed groups (of 29,457).
- Old corpus after G0.9: O = 544,034 rows / 972.6 h. Text audit (exact/punct/digit-folded/fuzzy) over old + both MaCro buckets: 0 FLEURS-test matches on every key; macro_filtered shares 749 sentences with D and 645 with holdout (removed by the builder). PCM hashing of every bucket, the fingerprint match and the corpus build are queued (chain 3) after SPRING ingests.
- Owner statements today: "I feel like Vaani will be removed eventually" (a prior, not a ruling); "as the A6000 is free, ablations can occupy it with 20 GB" → SPEC amended: pilots may run one arm per card (A5000 + A6000@20 GB cap), main run on the A5000 only.
- Trainer measured: 745 steps/h on the A5000 at microbatch 12 × accum 21, peak 8.5 GiB; validation ≈ 2.6 min per event.
- Provisional corpus if every bucket passes: O 973 h + macro 736 + madasr 894 + vaani 118 + spring ~650 ≈ 3,370 h / ~2.3 M rows → one epoch ≈ 9,100 steps; H = 150k ≈ 16.5 epochs; 8k-step pilots ≈ 0.9 epoch of N_final.

# QUESTIONS (answer with picks and numbers)
Q1 Two-card pilots: any comparability concern between arms trained on different cards (same code, bf16 autocast, same batch config, seeds)? Register the rule (e.g. O control must be run on the A5000; each arm's card recorded; a 200-step cross-card equivalence check of loss/LR/cut ids before trusting it)?
Q2 RESPIN: 894 h but only 20,038 distinct sentences (~32 speakers per sentence) and 1,791 speakers. Under MAX_PER_TEXT=5 the bucket collapses to ≤100k rows (~140 h). Is that the right treatment for a many-speakers-per-prompt dialect corpus, or should the cap be per (sentence, dialect) or raised for madasr only (registered before the build, with the reasoning)? Pick and give the number.
Q3 Vaani prior: given 118 h of verbatim spontaneous image descriptions with dialectal orthography, what is your expected sign on D (IndicVoices conversational-heavy) and on FLEURS (read Wikipedia)? Should the O+vaani arm be run at all, or deferred (owner's prior + 10.7 GPU-h)? Pick.
Q4 SPRING-INX: code-switched Latin words; G0.9(a) removes such rows and flags >5 % loss for owner review. Is there a better registered treatment (e.g. transliteration is forbidden; drop rows) — confirm, and say what to do if the loss is 5–15 %.
Q5 Horizon: at ~2.3 M rows, is H=150k (16.5 epochs) still right, or should H scale (e.g. 200k) given the corpus is 2.3× Phase 1's and Phase 1 ran 18 epochs and was still improving? Owner: GPU-hours soft. Pick H and the plateau rule.
Q6 Panel M: 1,964 single-recording groups (one recording per sentence because eligible groups are scarce). Is a 3.5 h / 1,964-recording M with ~1 recording/sentence acceptable, and what is its paired-bootstrap resolution (min detectable Δ)?
Q7 Anything in the contract that is now contradictory or stale after these facts (list exact lines to change)?
Q8 STOP/GO: given what is measured and what is still pending (hash audit, fingerprint match with an earlier round showing 17,920 'unresolved' of 29,462 macro_validated queries, listening boards, 1,000-step replay), what is the ordered checklist to launch the first pilot arm, and which items may run concurrently on the two cards?
